            <h3>Tip calculator</h3>
            <p>
              I have solely worked on my project without any teammate. I have
              completed it in one day as the project was very easy and is of
              basic level. I have tested the project against all test cases and
              it worked properly and no error was encountered. So my experience
              was very good while working on it. This is a simple yet functional
              web-based Tip Calculator designed to help users quickly calculate
              the total bill amount including a tip, and split the bill among
              multiple people. The user can input the bill amount, select the
              quality of service (which determines the tip percentage), and
              enter the number of people sharing the bill. The tool then
              computes the amount each person should pay. I developed this
              project independently as part of my learning journey in front-end
              development. It was a straightforward project that I completed
              within a day. I thoroughly tested it This project helped reinforce
              my understanding of HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript interactions.
